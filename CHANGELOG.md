# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Execution::Next is supported from graphql 2.6.2: in 2.5.26 to 2.6.1 a denied field crashes the engine.
  The integration refuses to run there.
- Gem skeleton: gemspec, Docker test image, RSpec with an execution-engine switch
  (`GRAPHQL_ARMORY_ENGINE=interpreter|next`) and a CI matrix.
